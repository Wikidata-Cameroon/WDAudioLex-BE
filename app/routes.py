@main_bp.route('/')
def home():
    """
    Home route for the application.

    This route does two things:
    1. Prints the list of templates available to Flask. This is useful for debugging and checking which templates Flask can find in the environment.
    2. Renders the 'index.html' template with a dynamic 'title' variable, which is passed from the route.

    The 'title' variable is used to set the page's title in the HTML head and can also be used within the page content.
